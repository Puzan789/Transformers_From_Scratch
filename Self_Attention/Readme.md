## Self-Attention in Transformer Neural Networks

### Overview
Self-attention is a key mechanism in transformer neural networks, enabling the model to weigh the importance of different input tokens in relation to each other. This mechanism allows the model to capture contextual relationships within a sequence, making it effective for tasks like natural language processing (NLP).

### Simple Description
1. **Input Representation**: Each input token is first converted into a fixed-size vector, known as an embedding. These embeddings capture the token's semantic meaning.

2. **Key, Query, and Value Vectors**: For each token, three vectors are computed:
   - **Query (Q)**: Represents the token's role in asking for related information from other tokens.
   - **Key (K)**: Represents the token's importance in providing information.
   - **Value (V)**: The actual content that might be relevant.

3. **Attention Scores**: The relevance of each token to every other token is calculated using the dot product of their Query and Key vectors. This gives a score matrix that shows how much attention each token should pay to others.

4. **Attention Weights**: These scores are scaled (usually by the square root of the dimensionality of the key vectors) and passed through a softmax function to get attention weights, which sum to 1 for each token's query vector.

5. **Weighted Sum of Values**: The final output for each token is a weighted sum of the Value vectors, weighted by the attention weights.

Query (Q): The question asked by the teacher. It seeks specific information or attention from the students.
Key (K): The information that each student provides in response to the question. It represents how much a student's response aligns with the question.
Value (V): The actual content or information that each student knows, which might be useful to answer the question.
