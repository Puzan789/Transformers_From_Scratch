# Encoder Architecture

The encoder architecture is composed of multiple layers that include multi-head attention mechanisms, layer normalization, and position-wise feed-forward networks. This explanation covers the main components and their mathematical operations.

## Components

### 1. Scaled Dot-Product Attention

The scaled dot-product attention is computed as follows:
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax((QK^T) / sqrt(d_k)) V
```
where `Q`, `K`, and `V` are the queries, keys, and values respectively, and `d_k` is the dimension of the keys.

### 2. Multi-Head Attention

The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces. The process is as follows:

1. Linear projections of `Q`, `K`, and `V`:
```
Q, K, V = W_QX, W_KX, W_VX
```
2. Apply scaled dot-product attention to each projected version of `Q`, `K`, and `V`:
```
head_i = Attention(Q_i, K_i, V_i)
```
3. Concatenate the heads and apply a final linear layer:
```
MultiHead(Q, K, V) = W_O(head_1 | head_2 | ... | head_h)
```

### 3. Layer Normalization

Layer normalization is applied to stabilize and accelerate the training. The normalized output is given by:
```
LN(x) = gamma * ((x - mu) / sqrt(sigma^2 + epsilon)) + beta
```
where `mu` and `sigma^2` are the mean and variance of the input `x`, and `gamma` and `beta` are learnable parameters.

### 4. Position-Wise Feed-Forward Network

The position-wise feed-forward network consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between:
```
FFN(x) = max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2
```

### 5. Encoder Layer

Each encoder layer contains multi-head attention and feed-forward networks, each followed by layer normalization and residual connections:
```
EncoderLayer(x) = LN(x + MultiHead(x, x, x))
```
```
EncoderLayer(x) = LN(x + FFN(x))
```

### 6. Complete Encoder

The complete encoder is a stack of `N` encoder layers:
```
Encoder(x) = EncoderLayer_N(... EncoderLayer_2(EncoderLayer_1(x)) ...)
```

## Code Explanation

### Initialization

The encoder is initialized with the following parameters:
- `d_model = 512`: Dimensionality of the model.
- `num_heads = 8`: Number of attention heads.
- `drop_prob = 0.1`: Dropout probability.
- `batch_size = 30`: Number of samples in a batch.
- `max_sequence_length = 200`: Maximum length of the input sequence.
- `ffn_hidden = 2048`: Dimensionality of the feed-forward network's hidden layer.
- `num_layers = 5`: Number of encoder layers.

### Encoder Class

The `Encoder` class is defined as:
```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, ffn_hidden, num_heads, drop_prob, num_layers):
        super().__init__()
        self.layers = nn.Sequential(*[EncoderLayer(d_model, ffn_hidden, num_heads, drop_prob) for _ in range(num_layers)])

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        x = self.layers(x)
        return x
```

### Example Usage

When running the script directly, the following code initializes the encoder, generates a random input tensor `x`, and passes it through the encoder:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    d_model = 512
    num_heads = 8
    drop_prob = 0.1
    batch_size = 30
    max_sequence_length = 200
    ffn_hidden = 2048
    num_layers = 5

    encoder = Encoder(d_model, ffn_hidden, num_heads, drop_prob, num_layers)
    x = torch.randn((batch_size, max_sequence_length, d_model))
    out = encoder(x)

    print("Output shape:", out.shape)
```

This concludes the explanation of the encoder architecture, highlighting its components and mathematical operations.
